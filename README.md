### What this code/simulation aims to do:
* Uncover the probabilities of certain complex compounds forming over time due to UV photolysis.
* Uncover the probabilities of certain building blocks of life forming over time due to UV photolysis.
* Uncover the best chemical compounds to begin with to create these complex organic materials.

### To-Do:
* Finish O2 Photolysis simulation
* Fix probabilities assignment algorithms
* Write all reactions pertaining to CO2 simulation
* Generate accurate graphs for ALL variables
* Finish CO2 Photolysis simulation
* Begin H2O and Ammonia simulation
